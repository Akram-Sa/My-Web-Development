<p>HTML means hyper text markup language</p>

<p>
  HTML <strong>elements</strong> are the <em>building</em> blocks of HTML pages.
  With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
  be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
  documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
  paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are
  delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
