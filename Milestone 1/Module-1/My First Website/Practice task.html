            The monkeys didn’t get going until a little bit later today and I was already awake by the time they were jumping on the roof. I got sorted, headed down to get a coffee and then waited for my pick up for my snorkelling trip. Then I waited and waited and waited. The guesthouse owner was even concerned and rang up to see that they hadn’t forgotten me. Eventually the taxi turned up and being the only solo traveller I scored the seat in the cab with the driver. Nice one! The roads were just as they had been the other day, very hilly.
